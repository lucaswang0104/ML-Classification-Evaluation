    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply the Decision Tree (DT) classification algorithm to a real-world machine learning dataset. Specifically, you will predict the type of a given bridge using a diverse set of features, including its material, length, number of lanes, and other structural properties. We use a modified version of the publicly available <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pittsburgh+Bridges\"> Pittsburgh Bridges Data Set</a>. (click the link for more information on all features and values).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Data Preparation** section, you will read the dataset into a data frame and perform data preprocessing (Q1.1). You will also need to develop code to convert the features to numeric values (Q1.2). Then, the data will be divided into two parts: Train and Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Model Training** section, we provide you with a number of helper functions that will be incorporated into the main Decision Tree function (Q2-8). Your task is to read and use these functions and explain the exact role of each helper function in developing a Decision Tree. You must provide a meaningful and descriptive name for each function that matches its specific role in training a Decision Tree model (e.g., count_labels, calculate_entropy, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can observe the use of each of these functions in the Main Decision Tree Algorithm, which you can use to print your trained tree. We have also provided the code for navigating a trained tree and using it to predict the labels for the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Classification and Evaluation** section, you will test and evaluate your model. You will implement functions to calculate the accuracy of the model predictions (Q9). Finally, you will train a tree and use it to predict the labels for the test set and see the accuracy of your model (Q10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11 concludes with analytical questions in which you will critically analyze the behavior of your decision tree in different situations.\n"

    "Yes, they are different. The train set accuracy decreases from 61.18% to 58.82%. This is mainly due to the 'material' data has an obvious distribution or characteristic, droping it lead to a change in the distribution of overall train model, then it capture a weak relationship between label and the data. The correct predictions decline. Hence, the accuracy decreases. The test set accuracy increases from 34.78% to 43.48%, this is mainly due to the 'material' data could be a noise of the overall test set. After dropping it, the test model can recognise more valid correlation among the remaining data. Hence, the accuracy increases. Secondly, dropping the 'material' data may reduce chance of the overfitting or the decision tree algorithm may get improved by dropping a column of data, both reasons lead to a better accuracy. Overall, after dropping the 'material' column, both data set exists occasionality with a rise or fall with the accuracy.    \n",

    "*(A) The training set accuracy is 61.18% which better than test set's 34.78%, there may exist a few possible reasons. Firstly, train set has 85 rows of data, but the test set only has 23 rows of data, the amount of test set are not enough to provide an ideal accuracy which is lower than 50%. Secondly, there could be a overfitting in the test set's model, this may lead to a decrease about the accuracy, and the train set model has a good fitting, therefore test model's accuracy is better. Thirdly, test model may exist more noises than in the train model, this may lead to a lower accuracy comparting to the train model  *\n",
    "\n",
    "*(B) For training set, the accuracy increases from 61.18%(depth=2) to 94.12%(depth=10) this is mainly due to a higher depth decision tree can recgonise more complicated patterns and relationships among the dataset, which enhances the fitting of the model  *\n",
    "  For test set, when the depth increases from 2 to 10, the accuracy keep remain at 34.78% this is probably due to the relationship between each feature is quite simple, therefore, the data could be predicted with a few splits. Hence, a deeper decision tree cannot improve a better accuracy. "
